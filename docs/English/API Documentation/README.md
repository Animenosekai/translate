# API Documentation

translatepy also provides a public HTTP API to use it on any service.

> *(and I know well that even if I didn't make it public, someone willing to use it would just go on the website and look at the requests made)*

This is the documentation for the public HTTP API, which is a modified version of the `translatepy server` built-in server.

It adds supports for starring translations, translators statistics, etc.
